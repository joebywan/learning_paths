## Recommended Commenting Practices for Engineers

If no formal guide is available, here are some best practices to ensure effective communication, avoid double handling, and provide transparency for both engineers and management. Good ticket comments help future assignees understand the thought process, research, and decisions already taken, ensuring smooth handoffs and minimizing rework. These practices also make it easier for management to understand progress and blockers in real-time.

### 1. **Daily Progress Updates**
   - **What to Include**: Share meaningful progress that provides insight into what has been achieved so far.
     - **Example**: “Completed unit tests and began working on integration. Encountering some challenges with API response timing, will investigate further tomorrow.”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Keeps the ticket active and up to date.
     - Ensures that anyone (e.g., management or team members) checking the ticket can see the current status without needing to ask.
     - Helps with accountability during stand-ups or sprint reviews.

### 2. **Blockers or Dependencies**
   - **What to Include**: Describe blockers or external dependencies clearly and immediately.
     - **Example**: “Blocked by missing access to the dev environment. Waiting for the infrastructure team to grant access – requested via JIRA-1234.”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Ensures management is aware of blockers and can escalate as needed.
     - Provides transparency so other stakeholders know what’s preventing progress.
     - Reduces frustration by clarifying delays and providing a point of contact or reference.

### 3. **Before Status Changes**
   - **What to Include**: Add a comment explaining actions taken before moving the ticket to a new status (e.g., “In Progress,” “Code Review,” or “Done”).
     - **Example**:  
       - *In Progress*: “Beginning to refactor authentication module. PR will be linked when ready.”  
       - *Code Review*: “PR #45 created. Unit tests passed, integration tests pending. Would appreciate feedback on edge-case handling.”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Avoids silent status changes that might confuse others monitoring progress.
     - Gives additional clarity for reviewers or QA when work is ready for their action.
     - Provides a natural handoff point with context for the next stage of the process.

### 4. **Detailed Context for Reviewers**  
   - **What to Include**: Summarize what has been done, link relevant documentation or code, and highlight any unusual decisions or trade-offs made.
     - **Example**:  
       “PR #47 addresses the bug in session management. Used approach A instead of B to avoid performance degradation. See commit 9a7f6e for a detailed breakdown of the changes.”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Makes it easier for reviewers to understand the scope and reasoning behind changes.
     - Reduces unnecessary back-and-forth by preemptively answering likely questions.
     - Ensures consistency and knowledge sharing across the team.

### 5. **Thought Process and Research Outcomes**
   - **What to Include**: Document the research, troubleshooting, or analysis you performed, even if it didn’t result in a direct solution.
     - **Example**:  
       “Investigated using Service A vs. Service B. Decided on Service B because of better API support, even though the initial setup is more complex. See notes in Confluence for more details.”  
       “Tried approach X to resolve the issue (logs attached), but the issue persisted. Moving on to approach Y.”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Ensures that future engineers don’t repeat work or investigate dead ends.
     - Helps in situations where a ticket gets reassigned, or the original engineer is unavailable.
     - Provides insight into the engineer's decision-making, which helps both teammates and management.

### 6. **Mentions and Ownership Changes**
   - **What to Include**: Tag relevant stakeholders or teammates when their action is needed or when handing off the ticket.
     - **Example**:  
       “@john_doe Please review the PR and provide feedback by EOD.”  
       “@qa_team Ticket is ready for testing. All requirements in the acceptance criteria are covered.”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Speeds up collaboration by notifying the right people at the right time.
     - Avoids confusion over ownership or next steps.
     - Encourages accountability and reduces bottlenecks.

---

### 7. **Final Comment on Closure**
   - **What to Include**: Add a final comment summarizing the outcome, key actions taken, and any follow-up required (if applicable).
     - **Example**:  
       “Resolved the caching issue by updating the Redis config. Monitored for 24 hours with no further incidents. Documentation updated [here].”
   - **Why It Matters**:  
     - Ensures everyone is aware of the resolution and final actions taken.
     - Acts as a historical reference in case the same issue resurfaces in the future.
     - Provides closure and confirms acceptance for both engineers and stakeholders.

### **Additional Benefits of Good Ticket Comments**
- **Improves Knowledge Sharing and Onboarding**: Documenting thought processes helps new team members ramp up faster by learning from existing tickets.
- **Reduces Management Overhead**: Well-maintained tickets eliminate the need for constant status requests and allow managers to monitor progress asynchronously.
- **Supports Retrospectives**: Detailed comments provide insights into what went well or poorly, feeding into continuous improvement practices.
- **Enhances Accountability**: Transparent updates ensure engineers take ownership of their work, while everyone remains aligned on priorities and status.

By consistently following these practices, you ensure that your tickets remain well-documented, easy to understand, and actionable. This not only enhances collaboration and communication but also minimizes frustration and lost time due to duplicated efforts or lack of clarity.
